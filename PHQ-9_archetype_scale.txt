I haven’t been wanting to do anything.
I’ve been feeling really low lately.
I can’t sleep properly—either too little or too much.
I barely have any energy to do things.
My appetite is totally messed up.
I feel like I’m not good enough.
I can’t focus on anything for long.
I feel like I’m moving in slow motion.
I just feel like giving up sometimes.
